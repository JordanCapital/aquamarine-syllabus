          language this week.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - What is
          each:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- UI is forms, buttons,
          mousemouse, keyboards (user interaction)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;- state is data, it's variables! often global, often arrays of
          objects (think spreadsheets!)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DOM is
          what we see. New term: \"render\"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- The circle of web
          apps:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- UI: User does a thing: eg.
          clicks a button<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- state: JS code updates
          the value of some var<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DOM: we use that
          new state value to \"render\", and update what we're showing<br>&nbsp;
          &nbsp;- Each part of this cycle corresponds to a chunk of
          code:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- UI: event handlers registration
          (onReady)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- state: updating global vars
          in handler<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DOM: render()<br>&nbsp;
          &nbsp;- Practical example: score keeper (add points in form, render
          total score)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Patterns! Patterns everywhere! &nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Patterns help us think about code, every app is
          similar in certain ways<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Writing code
          is all about following battle-tested patterns<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;- As you grow as a developer, you will learn more advanced
          patterns, discover your own, etc.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- This pattern will continue
          throughout T2, into react and beyond.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
          this job is hard, if we have to reinvent every line!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp;- but: you need to <i>understand</i> the pattern.
          Copy/Paste won't work on its own."

          How does "The Pattern" fit into this assignment?

          You will have an array of objects? What does each object represent? What properties does it have?

          What's your game plan? When are you putting in the time? What if it takes longer than you expect? Who do you call if you need a hand?
