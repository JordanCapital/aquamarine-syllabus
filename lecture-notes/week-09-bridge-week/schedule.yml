          Discuss in pods or pairs:

          Which methods of debugging worked best for you? 

          What else works for you? 

          What's the hardest part for you? 

          Could code have been written in a different way, that would have made debugging easier?

          What is refactoring and why?

          https://refactoring.guru/refactoring


          Demo live with WC1 (employee salary calc)

          Copy pasting code around

          Functions: what are the inputs (what data do we need)? What can we return?

          Avoiding globals, using args/returns when possible


          SRP: Functions should do one thing. If not, split it up.
